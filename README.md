# Checkout page 

**This project is a landing page with a form using most input types**.

I found the layout of this page at the link https://dribbble.com/shots/1322677-Checkout-Page/attachments/186093

The main feature is that project has **no javascript**. All events are used with help of **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements**.

Skills and technologies I used:

* semantic HTML
* BEM methodology
* SCSS predprocessor
